        Monarch Boutique was born through the transformation of the Monarch Butterfly. Everyday woman
        transform themselves and our boutique offers fashions and personal consultation to help you find the
        right fit and style for you.
        <br><br>
        The Monarch Butterfly combines a bit of the North and South which is what makes this such a unique
        boutique. The owner, Shari Wolsey moved from Canada to Sherman and the Monarch butterfly migrates each winter to the
        south from Manitoba.
        <br><br>
        Monarch Boutique has something for every woman in every size, jewelry, accessories and d√©cor. A
        little something for everyone!
        <br><br>
